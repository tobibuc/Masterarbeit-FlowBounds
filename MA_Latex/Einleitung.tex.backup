Today there are various real-world problems that are (tried to be) solved by computational methods. One of them which 
is currently attacked at the Konrad Zuse Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin (ZIB) is the Problem of transporting 
natural gas through a network of pipelines. Due to the physics of gas flows this turns out to be a nonlinear, nonconvex 
mixed-integer optimization problem, which is is quite hard to solve. 
For solving the nonlinear constraints, we compute a [linearization... TODO ]
On first glance it may seem that a relaxation to a normal Min-Cost-Flow algorithm could yield an appropriate bound 
on one arc to the problem. If you set the weight on the arc to 1 or -1 and all other weights on zero, you get a 
valid bound on the maximum or minimum possible flow on the arc. However, this bound is for most of the arcs far from 
reality. The
