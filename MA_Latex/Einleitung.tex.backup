Today there are various real-world problems that are (tried to be) solved by computational methods. One of them which 
is currently attacked at the Konrad Zuse Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin (ZIB) is the Problem of transporting 
natural gas through a network of pipelines. Due to the physics of gas flows this turns out to be a nonlinear, nonconvex 
mixed-integer optimization problem, which is is quite hard to solve. 
For solving the nonlinear constraints, we compute a [linearization... TODO ]
On first glance it may seem that a relaxation to a normal Min-Cost-Flow algorithm could yield an appropriate bound 
on one arc to the problem. If you set the weight on the arc to 1 or -1 and all other weights on zero, you get a 
valid bound on the maximum or minimum possible flow on the arc. However, this bound is for most of the arcs far from 
reality. The

Today more and more real-world problems in the areas of simulation and optimization are solved by mathematical and 
computational methods. A growing number of these problems can be solved without problems, i.e. even huge instances give 
an optimal or near optimal solution within seconds. Still, there remain problems that even on modern computers are hard 
to solve. For these problems it is important to find ways to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. 

The topic of this thesis arises from the computation of flow in natural gas networks, which is currently developed 
in the FORNE Project in a cooperation of OGE with universities and research insitutes including ZIB.

The flow of natural gas in a network is described by nonlinear equations and depends on many parameters, which makes 
the problem hard to solve. If we can find good upper and lower bounds for the flow on an arc during the preprocessing, 
we can hope to improve the behavior of the nonlinear solver by giving these tigther bounds. 

The flow is induced by pressure differences, so in reality there can't be cyclic flow (if we exclude compressor 
stations). Without the condition of acyclic flow, it is sufficient to run a standard min-cost-flow algorithm where the 
maximized arc $e$ gets weight $w_e = -1$ and all others are 0. However, the arising bounds are far from optimal. If arc 
$e$ is contained in any cycle we could decrease the cost by pushing more and more flow around this cycle until the arcs 
capacity is at its limits.

This master thesis will deal with the problem of finding a network flow with no directed cycles (acyclic flow), which at 
the same time maximizes the amount of flow on a specified arc $e$ of the network. We will discuss the complexity, an 
exact algorithm based on a mixed integer program with separation of inequalities that forbid cycles and also a heuristic 
approach that yields results much faster (but not optimal).%TODO am ende genauer schreiben was wirklich gemacht wurde
