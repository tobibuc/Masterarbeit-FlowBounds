\subsection{Motivation}
Natural gas is one of the most common ressources of energy in germany and makes up more than 20 percent of energy 
consumption. Most of this gas is produced in ressource-rich countries like Russia or Norway and transported to Germany 
through special pipelines. 
%TODO wie sollte ich das projekt am besten referenzieren?
This thesis evolved from a joint research project of the Konrad Zuse Zentrum fuer Informationstechnik Berlin(ZIB) with 
Open Grid Europe (OGE) who operate the largest network of gas pipelines in germany. 
A general overview over the work on the gas network planning problem is given in 
\cite{FuegenschuhGeisslerGollmeretal.2013}. The problem of finding settings for all active components of the network 
such that given demands and supplies can be sent through the network with respect to all constraints is the nomination 
validation problem. A description of the model used and work done for the nomination validation problem can be 
found in \cite{PfetschFuegenschuhGeissleretal.2012}. 

The flow of gas through a pipeline network is determined by physical conditions such as pressure and temperature. 
Pressure can be increased in compressor stations and controlled by elements like valves. Pressure loss along a pipe is 
described by ordinary differential equations. 

The computation of the flow is difficult due to numerical and algorithmical reasons. Good preprocessing 
routines can help a lot by reducing the domains and model sizes before the main computation is started.
Since the flow of gas in the network is always determined by pressure differences and flow is always going from higher 
pressure to lower pressure we know that flow in the network in general has to be acyclic. The only exception of this 
is a compressor station. An active compressor station can increase the pressure and by this could indeed cause cyclic 
flow. However we will simplify the model and assume acyclic flow. 
%TODO kann ich beweisen (sollle ich??) dass es immer eine gleichwertige azyklische loesung gibt?
We can compute a flow with 
maximum value on a specified arc in the network with a standard Minimum Cost Flow algorithm. 
However a Minimum Cost Flow Algorithm usually is allowed to have cyclic flows and thus will maximize flow by shifting 
it around a cycle containing the maximized arc as long as the flow on the cycle can be increased on every arc. 

The main question leading to this thesis was how we could improve bounds and compute flows if we assume the flow to 
have no cycles. Normal and multicommodity network flows are well known algorithmical problems, but (as far as the 
author knows) there is no work on acyclic network flows and how to compute them. 
Whereever we have a network with nonpositive lower capacity bounds, we can make any flow acyclic by shifting flow 
back on the cycles until an edge has zero flow. But if we are interested in the maximum possible flow on an edge under 
the condition of acyclicity things get more complicated. 

We simplified the problem by assuming that there are no compressor stations. At the same time we just ignore the 
physical properties of the gas. We do not compute or take care of any gas density, pressure or possible pressure loss. 
Pressure is only used to justify the assumption of acyclicity. This abstraction is justified by the fact that it is 
weaker than the original problem which also has to fulfill the flow conditions we use. The bounds are only needed 
for preprocessing and hoped to improve the model size in the end. 

\subsubsection{Related Work}
The diploma thesis of Thea Göllner \cite{DiplomarbeitTheaGoellner} describes preprocessing techniques for stationary gas 
network optimization models. This is the same model as the one we use here. In her thesis she also describes an 
algorithm for determining flow directions on the arcs of the network and determines cases in which we can fix the flow 
direction even on arcs contained in cycles of a certain kind. To achieve this she makes use of the acyclicity property 
of gas flow as well. 
Fixing a flow is basically saying that the lower flow bound in one direction is zero. Thus her work is a special case 
of the much more general approach on preprocessing acyclic bounds we have in here. The fixing of flow directions that 
she proposes works on induced paths of the network and on cycles where flow can only be coming in from one side. 
She also shows the restrictions of this approach and says that for many cases it is necessary to take pressure or flow 
quantity into account in order to see if one can fix the direction variable. 

Here we aim at computing more general acyclic flow bounds. So we can not only fix the direction of flow in some special 
cases but also give upper bounds on possible flow and bounds in cases were it is not clear which direction flow has to 
take. It still yields flow directions in the cases described. But in practice a combination of our models with the 
flow direction fixing Göllner did could improve runtime and quality, because for big networks we can only use heuristic 
algorithms in practice.
