\subsection{MIP Formulations}
For many combinatorial Problems it is the best practical solution to formulate them as a Mixed Integer Problem and just 
solve this problem with modern MIP Solvers such as CPlex, Gurobi, SCIP etc. Often there are different possible 
formulations as 
MIP, which might yield very different running times due to numerical or algorithmical reasons. In our problem, it is 
easy to model the flow conservation and the ingoing and outgoing flow on vertices. Like described before, we can assign 
a negative weight to an arc variable and this way maximize flow over this arc by minimizing the overall cost. This 
would be the typical MIP formulation of a min cost flow:

\begin{align*}
  &\min \sum_{a\in A} w_a\cdot x_a  \\
  %TODO an die balance-intervall formulierung anpassen
 s.t. & \sum_{a\in \delta^+(v)}x_a - \sum_{a\in\delta^- (v)}x_a = d_v\ &\forall v\in V \\
  & c_l(a)\le x_a \le c_u(a) & \forall a\in A
\end{align*}

This model still allows cyclic flow, so we have to find constraints to avoid cyclicity. 
\subsubsection{Model 1: Node Potentials}
%TODO welche formulierungen koennte es noch geben fuer dieses problem?
%TODO PORTA results and polytope of the problem?

One idea (that is unfortunately not a linear problem formulation anymore) would be to set potentials on the nodes and 
allow only flow from higher to lower potential. This is quite close to the application of our problem in gas flow 
computation, where gas will only flow from places with high pressure to places with lower pressure in the network. So 
each vertex $v$ would get a variable $\pi_v$ for its potential, each arc $a$ as before a variable $x_a$ for the amount 
of flow. Then we add the constraint $$x_a\cdot (\pi_v -\pi_w)\ge 0\,\forall a=(v,w)\in A $$
We have to ensure that the values of the potentials are all 
different, or that there is no flow between nodes of the same potential. Otherwise any solution where all potentials 
are set to the same value would fulfill this constraint, regardless if it is acyclic or not. So in practice we could 
set a constant $\varepsilon > 0$ to describe the minimum distance between the potentials. A feasible 
solution now has to fulfill the constraint above on every arc. If we set up the constraint as above, we get the Mixed 
Integer Nonlinear Program

\begin{align*}
  &\min \sum_{a\in A} w_a\cdot x_a & \\
 s.t. & \sum_{a\in \delta^+(v)}x_a - \sum_{a\in\delta^- (v)}x_a &=& d_v\ &\forall v\in V \\
 & x_a &\le& c_u(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 & -x_a &\le& c_l(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 & -x_a\cdot (\pi_v -\pi_w)&\le& 0 &\forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
 & (\pi_v - \pi_w)^2 &\ge& \varepsilon &\forall v,w \in V\\
 & x_a \in \R & & &\forall a\in A\\
 & \pi_v \in \R & & & \forall v\in V\\
 & d_a \in \{0,1\} & & &\forall a\in A\\
\end{align*}

We show that this flow indeed is an acyclic one:

\begin{prop}
 A flow which fulfills the constraints of the above nonlinear program is always acyclic.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Assume a flow fulfilling the above constraints would have cyclic flow on a cycle $C$. Without loss of generality 
we label the vertices on the cycle from $1$ to $n$ and assume all arcs are directed forward on this cycle. This means 
there are arcs $a_1=(v_1,v_2),a_2=(v_2,v_3), \dots a_n=(v_n, v_1)\in C$ such that $x_{a_i} > 0 \,\forall i={1,\dots , 
n}$. Also we know from the constraints  $x_a\cdot (\pi_v -\pi_w)\ge 0$ and $\pi_v - \pi_w \neq 0$ (Hence $\Rightarrow 
\pi_v\neq\pi_w)\, \forall v,w\in V$. So we conclude an ordering of the vertices potentials: $x_{a_1}\cdot (\pi_{v_1} 
-\pi_{v_2})\ge 0 \Rightarrow \pi_{v_1}>\pi_{v_2}$ and so on. This yields a sequence $\pi_{v_1}>\pi_{v_2}>\dots 
>\pi_{v_n}>\pi_{v_1}$, which is a contradiction. \Lightning
\end{proof}

However, solving nonlinear mixed integer programs comes with many difficulties, so we will use indicator constraints 
or an equivalent Big-M constraint to get a mixed integer formulation avoiding these difficulties. For this we  replace 
$$x_a\cdot (\pi_w -\pi_v)\le 0 \,\forall a=(v,w)\in A $$ and $$(\pi_v - \pi_w)^2 \ge \varepsilon \,\forall v,w \in V$$

%introduce rho (=richtung) variables
Instead we introduce a new binary variable $\rho_{vw}$ to indicate flow direction on $a=(v,w)$, and say this variable 
has to be 1 if flow is from $v$ to $w$ and 0 if it is from $w$ to $v$. Also if $\rho_{vw}$ is $1$ the potential 
$\pi_v$ of $v$ has to be greater than the potential $\pi_w$ of $w$ and the other way around. So with indicator 
constraints we get
\begin{align*}
 &\rho_{vw}=1 &\Rightarrow &\pi_v\ge\pi_w +1\\
 &\rho_{vw}=0 &\Rightarrow &\pi_w\ge\pi_v +1\\
 &\rho_{vw}=1 &\Rightarrow &f((v,w))\ge 0\\
 &\rho_{vw}=0 &\Rightarrow &f((v,w))\le 0\\
 &\rho_{vw} \in \{0,1\}&&
\end{align*}
We can express these indicator constraints by
\begin{align*}
 &\pi_v-\pi_w &\ge & N(\rho_{vw}-1)+1\\
 &\pi_v-\pi_w&\le &N\rho_{vw}-1 \\
 &f((v,w))&\ge& M(\rho_{vw}-1)\\
 &f((v,w))&\le & M\rho_{vw}\\
 &\rho_{vw} \in \{0,1\}&&\\
\end{align*}
where $N\in \R$ and $M\in \R$ are sufficient big constants. Sufficient big in this case could mean we choose 
$N=|V|\, ,M=\sum_{v\in V}|d(v)|$. \\
So the complete Mixed Integer Program is:

\begin{align*}
  &\min \sum_{a\in A} w_a\cdot x_a & \\
 s.t. & \sum_{a\in \delta^+(v)}x_a - \sum_{a\in\delta^- (v)}x_a &=& d_v\ &\forall v\in V \\
 & x_a &\le& c_u(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 & x_a &\ge& c_l(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 & \pi_v-\pi_w &\ge & N(\rho_{vw}-1)+1& \forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
 & \pi_v-\pi_w&\le &N\rho_{vw}-1& \forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
 & x_a&\ge& M(\rho_{vw}-1)& \forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
 & x_a&\le & M\rho_{vw}& \forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
 & x_a \in \R & & &\forall a\in A\\
 & \pi_v \in \R & & & \forall v\in V\\
 & d_a \in \{0,1\} & & &\forall a\in A\\
 & \rho_{vw} \in \{0,1\}&&& \forall a=(v,w)\in A\\
\end{align*}
%TODO show that these constraints are equivalent to the nonlinear ones? or make a comment at least?

\subsubsection{Model 2: Acyclicity Constraints On All Cycles}

Another idea to solve the Acyclic Flow Bound Problem (which was partially implemented in Lamatto by Robert Schwarz) is 
the following: Every arc has a direction and the 
sign of the flow on this arc tells us in which direction flow is send over this arc. Again we introduce variables 
$\rho_a\in \{0,1\}$ for each arc $a\in A$ that indicate the direction of flow and are coupled with the flow variables:
\begin{align*}
\rho_a=1 & \Rightarrow x_a\ge 0 \\
\rho_a=0 & \Rightarrow x_a\le 0
\end{align*}
These indicator constraints can be handled the way they are by standard MIP solvers, but to make them real MIP 
constraints we may formulate them as follows (with $M$ a constant sufficient big, e.g. $M=\sum_{v\in V}|d_v|$) :
\begin{align*}
 x_a + M\cdot (1-\rho_a) &\ge 0\\
 x_a - M\cdot \rho_a & \le 0
\end{align*}



Now we have decision variables for the flow direction, we have to add constraints to avoid cycles. If the flow is 
acyclic, each cycle should have at least two arcs with opposite directions. In other words, there has to be one arc
in forward direction and one in backward direction, so with $n:=|C|$ we get as constraint:
$$ 1\le\sum_{a\in C\textrm{ forward }} \rho_a + \sum_{a\in C\textrm{ backward }}1-\rho_a\le n-1$$

Let us formulate this in a slightly different way to get only one sum: For each cycle of size $C_n=C_l+C_m$ 
let $C_m$ be the number of arcs directed forward and $C_l$ the number of backward directed arcs. We define that always 
$C_l\le C_m$, so forward is defined as the direction where more arcs are pointing towards (left or right would only 
make 
sense in a planar embedding). Then we get the constraint $$1-l \le \sum_{a\in C}\rho_a\le n-(l+1)$$ that forbids any
cyclic flow on $C$. We will show later under which conditions such constraints also forbid cyclic flow on other cycles. 
%TODO was ist wenn gleich viele? Ist das als Definition so ueberhaupt ok?

So our MIP formulation of the model is finally
\begin{align*}
 &\min \sum_{a\in A} w_a\cdot x_a & \\
 s.t. & \sum_{a\in \delta^+(v)}x_a - \sum_{a\in\delta^- (v)}x_a = d_v\ &\forall v\in V \\
  & c_l(a)\le x_a \le c_u(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 &x_a + M\cdot (1-\rho_a) \ge 0 & \forall a\in A\\
 &x_a - M\cdot \rho_a \le 0 & \forall a\in A\\
 &1-l \le \sum_{a\in C}\rho_a \le n-(l+1) & \forall \textrm{ cycle }C\in G\\
 & x_a \in \R &\forall a\in A\\
 & \rho_a \in \{0,1\} &\forall a\in A
\end{align*}
or if we normalize the MIP to only $\le$ inequalities:
\begin{align}
 &\min \sum_{a\in A} w_a\cdot x_a & \\
 s.t. & \sum_{a\in \delta^+(v)}x_a - \sum_{a\in\delta^- (v)}x_a &=& b_v\ &\forall v\in V \\
 & x_a &\le& c_u(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 & -x_a &\le& c_l(a) & \forall a\in A\\
 &-x_a - M\cdot (1-\rho_a) &\le& 0 & \forall a\in A\\
 &x_a - M\cdot \rho_a &\le& 0 & \forall a\in A\\
 &1-l - \sum_{a\in C}\rho_a &\le& 0 & \forall \textrm{ cycle }C\in G\\
 & \sum_{a\in C}\rho_a +(l+1)-n &\le& 0 & \forall \textrm{ cycle }C\in G\\
 & x_a \in \R & & &\forall a\in A\\
 & \rho_a \in \{0,1\} & & &\forall a\in A
\end{align}


\subsection{The number of cycles we have to forbid}
The model above has one obvious problem we have to deal with: Since it has a constraint for every cycle of $G$ and the 
number of cycles in a graph might be exponential, even setting up the model would need exponential running time. 

So do we really need every cycle? Or is it enough to just forbid cyclic flow on a small subset (e.g. a cycle base) of 
the cycles of $G$? 

The figures \ref{bild:reichtkreisbasis1} and \ref{bild:reichtkreisbasis2} %TODO
show that a cycle base works on the easiest possible example, but fails if the problem gets just a bit more complicated:

\caption{Here it suffices to forbid the 2 interior cycles TODO in order to obtain acyclicity}
 \label{bild:reichtkreisbasis1}
\end{figure}
%beweis dass hier wirklich eine Kreisbasis reicht!

Why are the constraints of a cycle base sufficient in this case of figure \ref{bild:reichtkreisbasis1}? 

We see this immediately, when we look at all acyclicity constraints for the 3 cycles contained in the graph:
\begin{align*}
 1 &\le x_1+x_4+x_5\le 2&\\
 1&\le x_2+x_3+x_5\le 2& \iff -2\le -x_2-x_3-x_5\le -1\\
 -1 &\le x_1-x_2-x_3+x_4 \le 1&
\end{align*}
The last inequality is exactly the sum of the two inequalities above. Hence if two are fulfilled, the last one is 
automatically induced by them, it is a redundant constraint.

\caption{In this tetraeder graph \textbf{no} cycle bases' acyclicity constraints can enforce acyclic flow on the whole 
graph}
 \label{bild:reichtkreisbasis2}
\end{figure}
For figure \ref{bild:reichtkreisbasis2} the situation is more complex, though there is only one more arc in the graph. 
But the number of cycles grows exponentially, so we get 7 cycles in this case. Their inequalities are:
\begin{align*}
 1 &\le x_1+x_4+x_5\le 2&\\
 1&\le x_2+x_3+x_5\le 2& \\%\iff -2\le -x_2-x_3-x_5\le -1\\
 -1&\le x_3-x_4-x_6\le 0\\
 -1&\le x_1-x_2-x_6\le 0\\ 
 -1 &\le x_1-x_2-x_3+x_4 \le 1&\\
 0 &\le x_1+x_3+x_5-x_6\le 2\\
 1&\le x_2+x_4+x_5+x_6\le 3\\
\end{align*}
We could choose the three cycles $(e_1 e_5 e_4)$, $(e_2 e_5 e_3)$, $(e_3 \overline{e_6}\, \overline{e_4})$ as a cycle 
base, these cycles induce the first three constraints. By combining the first and second, we directly get the fifth 
inequality $-1 \le x_1-x_2-x_3+x_4 \le 1$ as above (this one is of course still redundant). But if we add inequality 
$3$, the result is 
\begin{align*}
 &&-1 &\le &x_1&-x_2&-x_3&+x_4 &&\le 1\\
 &+&-1&\le &&&x_3&-x_4&-x_6&\le 0\\
 &=&-2&\le&x_1&-x_2&&&-x_6&\le 1
\end{align*}
But the acylicity constraint of the cycle $(e_1 \overline{e_2} \,\overline{e_6})$ is $-1\le x_1-x_2-x_6\le 0$ instead. 
The resulting constraints are not sharp, because the left hand side and the right hand side depend on the length of the 
cycles, which changes while we combine them.

\begin{prop}
 Given two acyclicity constraints $cons_1$ and $cons_2$ of cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $G$. The acyclicity constraint of 
the joint cycle $C=C_1\cup C_2 \setminus \{a\in A| a\in C_1\land a\in C_2 \}$ is the sum of $cons_1$ amd $cons_2$ if 
and only if $C_1$ and $C_2$ have exactly one arc in common (and this arc is directed differently in both 
cycles/constraints).%TODO.
\end{prop}
This proposition shows that a many of the acyclicity constraints in our model are redundant and can be omitted. But 
still the remaining constraints are exponentialin the size of $G$.

\begin{proof}
 Assume we are given two cycles $C_1,\,C_2\in G=(V,A)$ with exactly one arc $g\in A$ 
contained in both cycles, and the direction of the cycles such that $g$ is forward in one cycle and backward in the 
other cycle. Without loss of generality we assume it is forward in $C_1$ and backward in $C_2$, i.e. $x_g$ has a 
positive sign in $cons_1:\,lhs_1\le \dots\le rhs_1$ and a negative sign in $cons_2:\, lhs_2\le \dots\le rhs_2$, which 
are the acyclicity constraints of $C_1$ and $C_2$. 

$\Rightarrow :$ 
The acyclicity constraints $lhs \le \dots\le rhs$ are constructed such that always $rhs-lhs=l-2$, $l$ being the length 
of the cycle the constraint belongs to. Consider two cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ and let $J\subset A=\{a\in A|a\in C_1 
\land a\in C_2 \}$ be the set of arcs that are contained in both cycles, $j:=|J|$. 

If we sum up the constraints $cons_1$ and $cons_2$ of the cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ we obviously get another constraint,
say $cons_3:\, lhs=lhs_1+lhs_2\le\dots\le rhs_1+rhs_2=rhs$. The length of the joint cycle $C$ is $l=l_1+l_2-2\cdot j$. 
We have 
$$rhs-lhs=rhs_1+rhs_2-lhs_1-lhs_2=\underbrace{rhs_1-lhs_1}_{l_1-2}+\underbrace{rhs_2-lhs_2}_{l_2-2}=l_1+l_2-4$$
It holds
$$l_1+l_2-4=l_1+l_2-2j-2=l-2 \iff j=1$$ 
This means that only if $C_1$ and $C_2$ have exactly one arc in common (i.e. $j=1$), the necessary condition 
$rhs-lhs=l-2$ is fulfilled to get the new acyclicity constraint.

$\Leftarrow :$ Now we have to show that we get a sharp acyclicity constraint every time we sum up two acyclicity 
constraints that have exactly one variable in common, and this has different sign in both constraints (so it cancels 
out). Let $cons_1$ and $cons_2$ be chosen this way and $C_3=C_1\cup C_2\setminus (C_1\cap C_2)$ be the resulting cycle, 
then we get:
\begin{align*}
 &&1&\le &\sum_{a \textrm{ forward in }C_1}x_a + \sum_{a\textrm{ backward in }C_1}{(1-x_a)}&&\le &l_1-1\\
 &+&1&\le &\sum_{a \textrm{ forward in }C_2}x_a + \sum_{a\textrm{ backward in }C_2}{(1-x_a)}&&\le &l_1-1\\
 &=&2&\le &\sum_{a \textrm{ forward in }C_3}x_a +\sum_{a\textrm{ backward in }C_3}{(1-x_a)}+
 &\underbrace{x_a+1-x_a}_{a\in C_1\cap C_2} &\le &l_1+l_2-2\\
 \iff &&1&\le &\sum_{a \textrm{ forward in }C_3}x_a +\sum_{a\textrm{ backward in }C_3}{(1-x_a)}
 &&\le &\underbrace{l_1+l_2-2}_{l_3}-1\\
\end{align*}
which is exactly the acyclicity constraint of the cycle $C_3$.
\end{proof}
%other redundant constraints: if in the middle there is no source or sink
There are still more redundant acyclicity constraints than these. Under certain conditions the acyclicity of smaller 
cycles implies the acyclicity of combined cycles even if there is more than one arc contained in both cycles.

\begin{prop}
 Given two cycles $C_1, C_2$ with a set of shared arcs $J:=\{a\in C_1|a\in C_2\}$ which we assume to have size greater 
than one ($j:=|J|>1$). If $J$ is a path in the graph with no sink or source vertex in the interior, the acyclicity of 
$C_1, C_2$ together implies acyclicity of the cycle $C_3:=C_1\cup C_2\setminus C_1\cap C_2$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 We proove this via contradiction. If the common arcs $J$ are a path like above, they have flow always in the same 
direction. Suppose $C_1$ and $C_2$ are acyclic, but $C_3$ is not. This means in both $C_1$ and $C_2$ there are arcs 
with different directions on the cycle, while they are all in the same direction on $C_3$. This means, the arcs with 
different direction have to be in the path $J$ of shared arcs of $C_1$ and $C_2$. Hence within the path $J$ there must 
be arcs which are directed different to each other. This can only happen, if one of the vertices in the interior of $J$ 
is a sink or a source. \Lightning
\end{proof}
%verallgemeinerung: teilt ein kreis den graph in zwei teile, dann ist es ausreichend wenn im innern azyklizität gegeben 
%und keine quelle/senke vorhanden ist? (verallgemeinerung von planarem Fall)
We can prove something more general by giving conditions that apply in more cases:
\begin{prop}
 Given a graph $G=(V,A)$ , without loss of generality assumed to be connected, and a cycle $C\subset G$ with the 
following properties:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $G\setminus C$ is disconnected
  \item Let $G'$ be a connected component of $G\setminus C$ 
  \item $G'$ has no source or sink nodes
  \item $G'\cup C$ consists of cycles whose direct sum is $C$ %TODO is direct sum what I really mean? Define it?
 \end{itemize}
 Then any acyclic orientation of the other cycles than $C$ in $G'\cup C$ implies already the acyclicity of $C$. 

\end{prop}
%Beweisen, dass in einem Gebiet ohne Quellen oder Senken (das planar ist?) einfache kreise reichen
\begin{proof}
 Consider only the subgraph $G'\cup C$ and assume $C$ had a cyclic orientation. In $C$ there has to be a chordal path 
through $G'$. Since there are no sources or sinks in $G'$, in fact there must be a \textit{directed} path from one node 
$v_1 \in C$ to another node $v_k\in C$ going through $G'$: starting from any arc incident to a node on $C$ and one in 
$G'$, we will always find another arc from the endnode in the same direction unless we run into a cycle or a 
source/sink node. But since neither exists in $G'$, after a finite number of arcs we come to a node on $C$ again. Thus 
we can always find a directed path in our setting. 

But there are two smaller cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ if we divide $C$ along this path. $C$ is a directed cycle and the path 
is also directed $\Rightarrow$ so one of the two cycles has to be directed, which contradicts our assumption. 
\Lightning 

Hence we conclude that acyclicity and absence of sources/sinks in the interior of a cycle make its acyclicity 
constraint redundant.
\end{proof}

%remark that this more general proposition is important for the planar case
There are some special cases where the above result can be very helpful and indeed reduce the number of needed 
acylicity constraints to polynomial size. This is not only relevant in theory, but also in practice: a real world gas 
network might have (at least partially) a planar graph representation. Planar graphs fulfill the condition to find a 
cycle the is dividing the graph into different parts easily - each cycle in a planar graph embedding divides the graph 
into interior and exterior. If we have only one source and one sink and find an embedding where both are on the outer 
(unbounded) face of the graph, it is sufficient to have the acyclicity constraints only on the face cycles of the 
graph. The same holds for all areas or subgraphs without sources/sinks that are enclosed by a cycle: we only need small 
simple cycles and all other acyclicity constraints are redundant.

%BILD : Bei einem Gitter mit vielen Quellen/Senken sind wir verloren... !
Still we have a problem with the sources and sinks. If there are many of them we still run into exponential numbers of 
acyclicity constraints.

\subsection{A Path-Based Heuristic Approach}
Since solving big real world instances of Mixed Integer Programs is often slow, we also want to discuss am approach 
to get weaker results with a heuristic that is running much faster. The goal is still to get upper and lower bounds 
on the flow over an arc. This is not necessarily an optimal bound but any feasible bound. 

The main idea is to create an algorithm that uses path augmentation to saturate the given flow - but to try to get as 
much flow value as possible to the arc where flow is maximized. Algorithms that use path augmentation to compute flows 
are well known and belong to the standard flow algorithms. The algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson 
\cite{Ford-Fulkerson_algo} arising from their Max-Flow-Min-Cut theorem is based on source-sink-paths in the 
network as well as the improved algorithms of Edmonds and Karp \cite{EdmondsKarp1972} or Dinic \cite{Dinic1970}. 

The advantage of this approach is clear: it is very easy to compute a path from one node to another or decide that 
there is none. It can essentially be done by simple graph search algorithms. Some Maximum Flow algorithms use shortest 
path as subroutine in order to prove their optimality. In our case the problem is that we would set negative weigth 
on the arc to maximize flow. But the shortest path with negative edge weights is equivalent to longest path, which is 
known to be NP complete by an easy reduction to hamiltonian path. \cite{}%TODO zitiere eine quelle dazu!

If we want to maximize flow over arc $a=(u,v)$ we just look for a path from our source $s$ to node $u$ and one from node 
$v$ to a sink $t$. Of course we have not ensured that the two paths have no arcs or nodes in common, so if we combine 
them this could produce cyclic flow, see for example figure \ref{bild:cycleFromCombinedPaths}. %TODO BILD

But on every path the flow is going over $a$ only once, while in a MIP formulation as normal Min-Cost Flow Problem it 
could be as much as the capacity of $a$ allows. This heuristic is still a valid upper bound on the flow on $a$, though 
it might allow cyclic flow over the maximized arc.
