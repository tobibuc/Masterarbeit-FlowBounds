The acyclic flowbound problem turns out to be an interesting mathematical and algorithmical problem. For the more 
general Acyclic Minimum Cost Flow Problem with arbitrary weights we showed the $\mathcal{NP}$ hardness, however it 
remains an open question if this is only due to the unlimited number of arcs with negative arc weights. If so, there 
might be a chance to find a direct, efficient algorithm.
Despite this the implemented MIP models showed a huge increase in running time even for moderate problem sizes. This 
indicates some hardness of the problem itself. To the author it apperas unlikely that the Acyclic Flowbound Problem 
should not be $\mathcal{NP}$ hard.

However, small problems were solvable with both models described and implemented in this thesis to optimality. With 
enough time and effort also a limitation of these models running time by time or MIP nodes yields good bounds.
