% The models we described have also been implemented and tested on networks of different size.
In this section we will discuss practical implementation and results of the computation. For relevant real-world 
problem sizes the exact algorithm (even with separation of the acyclicity constraints) is too slow. Hence we also 
describe how to relax the problem in order to get useable (though in general not optimal) results for the flow bounds. 
We compare the bounds found by different approaches/settings in different networks and nominations to see which 
approach is suited best to actually compute acyclic flow bounds in a network. 

At last we compare the impact of bounds and the number of fixed variables fed into the solver on the model sizes of the 
discretization. \\
